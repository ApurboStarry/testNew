# MODULES

# A module in python is basically a file with python code
# it is used to break codes in different files instead of writing all the
# codes in one file
# this increases modularity and helps to reuse them
# Moreover it allows to address accidentally occurred errors very efficiently

# Again there are two ways to import a module

# 1st way
from converters import kg_to_lbs

print(kg_to_lbs(65))

#2nd way
import converters
print(converters.kg_to_lbs(67))

# So, to import a specific function of a module we use "from ... import ...
# and by this process we can use the imported function as it were defined
# in this python file

# If we use "import ...", all the functions of that module is imported
# but to to access any function, we need to prefix that function by the
# moudule name and the dot(.) operator

# Exercise for Modules
import utils

# PACKAGES

# A Package is a container for multiple MODULES
# Instead of adding all the modules in only one directory, we can accumulate
# modules in different related directories which are called Packages

# But to convert a directory to a Package, we have to add a python file
# in that directory called "__init__.py"

# Efficiently, we can create a new Package in PyCharm by adding a new
# "Python Package" in that project folder

# Importing a specific function from a module of a package
from ecommerce.shipping import calc_shipping
calc_shipping()
calc_shipping()

# Importing the entire module of a package
from ecommerce import shipping
shipping.calc_shipping()

# Importing the entire package
import ecommerce.shipping

ecommerce.shipping.calc_shipping()


# So, we can see that if we import an entire package, to access a specific
# function we have to prefix the name of "Package" and "Module" by the dot(.)
# operator
#
# If we import a specific module from a package, we have to prefix the module
# name and a dot(.) operator to access any specific function
#
# Again if we import a specific function from a specific module of a package,
# we can simply access that function as if the function were defined in the
# current python file
